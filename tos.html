					<h2>Overview </h2>
					
					<p>Lapel Pins & Coins believes in superior customer service and we provide a quality guarantee with each order!
					
					These are the terms and conditions that governs all orders.
					
					Each order relies on you for important information to produce any specific custom products such as lapel pins, challenge
					coins, Lanyards, badges, keychains and other various promotional products. As we work together each party has
					responsibilities. We have included these responsibilities below.
					</p>

					<h2>Lapel Pins & Coins / Company is responsible for:</h2>
					<p>Accurate order information, before production begins, you will receive via e-mail a digital proof of your final
					custom-made product. This high-quality digital proof will allow you to spell check, verify color, size and make any
					additional changes or corrections prior to starting production. The "size" of your lapel pin, keychain or coin is
					determined by measuring the widest or tallest point of your design.
					</p>

					<h2>It is important that you indicate your color choices by using Pantone PMS numbers.</h2>
					<p>We use the “Pantone Matching System”, PMS colors, All Pantone (PMS) numbers will be listed on the art proof so you can
					verify them. For more information about the Pantone site please visit www.pantone.com. NOTE: Computer monitors and
					printers do not display colors the same, you should always confirm your color choice by consulting a Pantone (PMS) color
					chart.
					Confirming your order, order confirmations sent via email will contain specifications including type, size, colors,
					quantity, pricing and the estimated production time along with final art proof. Also, a link to our terms and conditions
					page. If the specifications and final digital art proof meet your satisfaction, then confirm your approval via e-mail.
					Once confirmed we will start the production process immediately. All orders placed through our online system allows for
					a complete review of your ordering details, along with our Terms and Conditions. Therefore, online orders do not require
					a Confirmation Letter email.
					</p>

					<h2>Producing your order correctly and shipped on-time.</h2>
					<p>Once we have received your approval / confirmation and payment, we will begin production on your order immediately. We
					will give expected delivery dates but we have no control over deadlines with shippers and can not one hundred percent
					guarantee their exact delivery time frames do to their unforeseen issues.
					</p>

					<p>
						We stand behind our products one hundred percent, every product we manufacture has a one hundred percent quality
						guarantee. We will replace any defective custom product. We only require that you submit a written claim of defective
						product within 30 days of receipt. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "defect" or "defective" means manufacturing
						error.
					</p>

					<h2>You / Customer are responsible for:</h2>
					<p>Customer carefully reviewing art proof provided. Once you have received the digital proof, please give special attention
					to the design you have chosen. Carefully check the spelling and Pantone PMS colors chosen. If no changes or corrections

					you with no marketable value to our company for cancelled orders.
